# Efficient-Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Semantic-Segmentation

This code is inspired from paper "ENet: A Deep Neural Network Architecture for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation" by Adam Paszke, Abhishek Chaurasia, Sangpil Kim, Eugenio Culurciello

Dataset : CamVid Dataset
Library : Keras with Tensorflow as Backend
Batchsize :  Standard Batchsize is 10, Set to 1 ( my PC  has 8GB RAM , multiple batchsize does not run in my current PC settings)


Command to train the model
-------------------------
python3 trainEnet.py

Command to test the model
-------------------------
python3 predict.py
